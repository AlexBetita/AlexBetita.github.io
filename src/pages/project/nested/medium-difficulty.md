Medium difficulty was our take in bringing back a forum meant for gamers. Our first application made in AppAcademy utilizing what we've learned throughout the first couple of weeks in a team environment.

Users can login, signup and edit their accounts, users can create discussions, edit discussions, delete discussions, users can comment, edit comments and delete comments on discussions, users can view other users profile and see what discussions they've made, users can follow/unfollow other users, users can then see more of the discussions the users they follow.

Medium difficulty is made purely on Javascript using the Express framework because of minimal and flexible robust set of features for web applications.

Style and CSS made using Pug JS for those complex UI/UX interactions, without Pug we would have a difficult time creating a intuitive user experience.
