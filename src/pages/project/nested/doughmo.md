DoughMo a clone of venmo. Allows users to create accounts and make transactions with their friends, businesses, payments and bills.

Users would be able to create an account, login and edit their profile, send transactions, make payments, receive payments, edit their profile, comment on transactions, edit comments, delete comments, view other users comments, add payment details, delete payment details, edit payment details, add friends, accept friends, and delete friends.

DoughMo is made mostly of React and utilizes a lot of Reacts features for that single page interaction, good use of components and component reusability, well-defined lifecycle and was easy to implement beacuse of its use of plain Javascript.

DoughMo's backend was made using python for fast api calls, mathemicatl operations for the transactions, use of sqlAlchemy for quick and easy queries.
